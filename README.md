## Overview

Phishing-Detector is designed to protect users from phishing attacks by assessing the safety of URLs in real-time. It utilizes a series of detection algorithms to analyze URLs for signs of phishing attempts. The modular architecture allows easy updates to detection rules as new phishing tactics evolve, ensuring that the system remains secure and effective over time.

### Why Phishing-Detector?

This project helps developers integrate phishing detection into their security infrastructure easily. The key benefits include:

- **Modular Design**: The system is built with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily extend and update detection rules to adapt to new threats.
- **Multi-Rule Analysis**: Combines various detection strategies for a thorough assessment of URLs, increasing detection accuracy.
- **REST API Integration**: The tool provides a REST API to integrate real-time URL checking into applications with ease.
- **Clear and Structured Results**: The analysis results are clear and structured, providing developers with actionable insights to make informed decisions.
- **Secure and Reliable**: Ensures consistent and accurate threat detection to safeguard users and systems against phishing attempts.

## Features

- **Real-time URL Analysis**: Check URLs against a set of detection rules to identify phishing attempts.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily scale the detection system by adding new detection rules and strategies.
- **Extensibility**: Extend the project to support new phishing tactics by adding new modules or improving existing detection rules.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides detailed reports of phishing assessments, helping developers take appropriate actions.
- **Secure**: The tool has been designed with security best practices in mind, ensuring that it remains effective in the face of evolving phishing threats.
